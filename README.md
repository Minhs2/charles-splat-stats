# charlessplatstats
Gets data from WowItsCharles's Splatoon Google sheet and outputs it to txt file for display on OBS.

Requires lxml and beautifulsoup4:

pip install lxml

pip install beautifulsoup4

An extremely quick, non-customizable, and messy implementation. Also my first Python experience.

If worked upon, can easily add:

- User input for URL, string output, and how long to wait until automatically updating.
- Flexibility for other formatted spreadsheets
- Toggle whether the user wants to manually update or not
- A GUI
- A way to stop updating the txt file without forceful termination
